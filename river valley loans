The minimum required credit score for a personal loan depends on the individual lender, so evaluate individual lender requirements before applying. If you struggle with your credit and are looking for a personal loan, there are bad credit personal loans available. These loans tend to have more flexible requirements, and lenders weigh a borrower’s entire financial history with less focus on credit scores.

If you are looking to take out a personal loan with less than stellar credit, there are many things to consider. The lower your credit score is, the higher the interest rate on your loan is likely to be. Because a lower credit score means more risk for the lender, the terms of your loan are likely to be less flexible than a borrower with a higher credit score.

Make sure that the loan terms you qualify for will work for you, and that you will be able to comfortably pay back the loan. Borrowers should also look out for predatory lending by verifying a lender’s credentials before applying.
